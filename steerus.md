### Role: Frontend Framework Developer 

For my Senior Capstone, I was able to work with <a href="https://www.steerus.io/">STEERus</a>. The Framework team consisted of 5 members:
- Project Manager 
- 2 Frontend Developers
- 2 Backend API Developers
<br>
For the Spring 2020 semester, I was able to work with another Frontend developer, where we split our tasks accordingly.
**STEERus** is a lean startup that plans on creating a social coaching platform for students and new graduates to be prepared for the real world, helping people develop their soft skills.

<br><br>

Using the <a href="https://www.mangoapps.com/">MangoApps Digital Workplace Platform</a>, as it is an integrated suite of workplace apps, our team was tasked with changing the default branding to fit the needs of our sponsor, as well as improving overall navigation for our user types, students and coaches.

<br>
Using custom CSS, we were able to change the branding on MangoApps to match STEERus and their branding.
<br><br>

- **Improve Navigation/Create Specific User Flows**
<br>
Coach users have more "admin" roles and access across the app. They also manage students and can communicate with them.

<br><br>
Student users are split between "Freemium" and "Premium" access types to coaching capsules. The limitations on access were determined by if the user paid for the service or not.

- **Coaching Capsules in MangoApps Framework:**
<br>
Coaching Capsules are the main content for STEERus, and we created specific coaching capsules based on the Top 10 soft skills found on their website, along with other capsules we felt fit with the situation going on during the semester. For "Premium" capsules, a lock indicates that free users cannot access it and they are asked to notify an admin if they are interested in joining/payment.

<br>
We utilized the "Projects" module in the MangoApps framework for Coaching Capsules with all the posibilities of customization that it allowed us to include for different modules to be included
<br><br>
**Free Coaching Capsules** 
<br>
Free Coaching Capsules only have "Posts" and "Pages" modules in them, there is limited content for these users.
