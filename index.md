## Who am I?
<br><br>
I just recently completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology with a specialization in Web Development and a minor in User Experience Design at New Jersey Institute of Technology
<br><br>
Just a little bit about me, I guess you can say I have a lot of hobbies and interests. I enjoy playing video games ranging from Animal Crossing on Nintendo Switch to various Japanese RPGs on Playstation 4 as well. I can play a few instruments: guitar, bass, viola, ukulele and piano just to name a few. I also really like anime and I have a figure collection of over 50+ figures and model kits hanging around my room.
