I just recently completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology with a specialization in Web Development and a minor in User Experience Design at New Jersey Institute of Technology

Just a little bit about me, I guess you can say I have a lot of hobbies and interests. I have a strong passion for music, I'm currenty teaching myself bass! I also play a lot of Animal Crossing and other JRPGs in my free time. And I really like anime, to the point that I have a figure collection of over 50+ figures and model kits hanging around my room.
