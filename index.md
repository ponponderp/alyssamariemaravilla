## Hello! 
<br>
I'm currently a graduate student at [New Jersey Institute of Technology](https://www.njit.edu) studying Information Systems, specializing in Data Analytics.
Recently graduated from New Jersey Institute Technology with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology, specializing in Web Development back in 2020.
<br>
I can help build web applications and I also build you a computer!
<br><br>
Just a little bit about me, I have a strong passion for music, I'm currenty teaching myself bass! I also play a lot of Animal Crossing and other JRPGs in my free time. And I really like anime, to the point that I have a figure collection of over 50+ figures and model kits hanging around.
