I can help build applications and I also build you a computer

Just a little bit about me, I have a strong passion for music, I'm currenty teaching myself bass! I also play a lot of Animal Crossing and other JRPGs in my free time. And I really like anime, to the point that I have a figure collection of over 50+ figures and model kits hanging around.
